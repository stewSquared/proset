Projective Set is the game of finding 2-dimensional subspaces in \mathbb{F}_2^6.

At present, this is implementation has two interfaces: a (1) pure CLI
game and a (2) CLI game + pygame display. A GUI point-and-click
implementation is pending.

Very few pygame apps are made with python 3 (yet), so it's not likely
that anyone will take the time to build the latest version of pygame
from the mecurial repository just to play this.

The next step is a scala/play-framework/HTML5 implementation that runs
persistently on a server and allows for an unspecified number of players
to drop in and procrastinate away.
