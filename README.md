proset
======
Projective Set is the game of finding 2-dimensional subspaces in \mathbb{F}_2^6.

At present, this is a working cli proset implementation in python3.

Soon, this will have an interface made with pygame, as a learning project for
myself. Very few pygame apps are made with python 3 (yet), so it's not likely
that anyone will take the time to build the latest version of pygame from the
mecurial repository just to play this.

The next step is a scala/play/html5 implementation that runs persistently on a
server and allows for an unlimited number of players to drop in and
procrastinate away. Also as a learning project for myself.
